FinTech Mobile Application – UI Prototype
This repository contains the User Interface (UI) Design Prototype for our FinTech mobile application, developed as part of our group project at Limkokwing University – Faculty of ICT (March 2025 to July 2025 semester).
The prototype was built using Figma and showcases the core features and visual design of the mobile app.

About the Project 

This project is a FinTech Mobile Application Prototype designed to provide users with a smooth, secure, and user-friendly financial experience. It is developed as part of our academic coursework under the Faculty of Information and Communication Technology at Limkokwing University, Sierra Leone for the March 2025 – July 2025 semester.
The prototype showcases the core features and interface layout of a digital wallet application tailored for both basic financial transactions and modern mobile banking needs.


Project Objectives 

Build a user-centered FinTech prototype that addresses real-world financial use cases.
Demonstrate UI/UX best practices using Figma for both wireframing and high-fidelity designs.
Simulate key interactions and user flows to guide future development and user testing.
